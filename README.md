# Real-World Oblique Crack Detection Dataset

This repository provides a dataset consisting of **1,417 images** captured by industrial cameras mounted at oblique angles on inspection vehicles in **Linyi, Shandong Province, China**. The dataset presents complex road scenes, featuring **non-uniform surfaces, vehicles, pedestrians**, and other environmental elements, which makes it suitable for developing and testing crack detection and quantification models in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains images captured in realistic and challenging environments, making it ideal for training and evaluating crack detection models that need to generalize well to diverse, real-world conditions. These images have been used in the research work titled **"CrackAdaptNet: End-to-End Domain Adaptation for Crack Detection and Quantification"**, where the proposed framework was tested for crack segmentation under various conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Total Images:** 1,417
- **Capture Method:** Industrial cameras mounted at oblique angles on inspection vehicles
- **Location:** Linyi, Shandong Province, China
- **Scene Characteristics:** Non-uniform road surfaces, various environmental elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, and complex backgrounds
